========

This is a small remote console client for Enemy Territory: Quake Wars.
It can be used to remotely send commands to a server.

compiling
---------

The program is written in ANSI C and I've tested it with TCC 0.9.25, GCC 4.3.2
and MSVC 15.0, but it probably compiles on others as well.

usage
-----

Run the program without arguments to see the parameters. The server must have
the net_ServerRemoteConsolePassword variable set before remote console can be
used:

	net_ServerRemoteConsolePassword "PASSWORD"

The server will respond with an error if the remote console is not enabled.
